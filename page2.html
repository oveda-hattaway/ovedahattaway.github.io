        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p class = "aboutMePara">I graduated from Statesboro High School in spring of 2018, and now I am currently a second year student studying <i>Computational Media</i> at Georgia Tech. I'm also studying to obtain a minor in <i>Spanish</i>. Coming into Tech, I was an international affairs student, but quickly realized that it wasn't for me.</p>
        <h2>My Dream</h2>
        <p class = "aboutMePara">After changing my major from International Affairs to Computational Media, my life goals drastically changed. I have always loved Spanish, so I decided to keep the minor. My absolute dream job is one where I can use my knowledge of computers to help teach foreign languages. Preferrably I would love to design computer games for language learning.</p>
